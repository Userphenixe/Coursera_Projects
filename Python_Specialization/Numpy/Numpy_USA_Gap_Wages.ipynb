We'll discuss Jupyter Notebooks in more detail later in the course—they are very a powerful tool for data science communication!—but for the time being, the notebook is just a convenient way for us to write out the exercise. You don't need to *do* anything with the notebook except read its contents—just use write your Python code in a regular `.py` file.\n",

As a result, when we calculate the average hourly wage of the people in the survey, it isn't *quite* the best estimate we have for the average hourly wage for everyone working in the United States. To calculate this number as accurately as possible, we have to take into account the fact that some respondents in the data were more likely to be included than others, and thus can be thought of as standing in for a smaller group of people in the US.\n",

The main reason is that if we want to make statements about a group in a survey like this, the accuracy of those statements will depend on the number of individuals who have actually ended up taking the survey. If we are interested in a big group—like White men—we are almost guaranteed to have enough of them in any reasonably sized survey to be able to make accurate statements about that subpopulation. But if we were interested in the life experiences of, say, people in their twenties who have a high school diploma but never attended college, and who live in rural communities, we may have to make a deliberate effort to ensure that there are more of those people in our survey than when we would get if we just took a random sample where everyone in the United States had the same probability of being included.\n",
